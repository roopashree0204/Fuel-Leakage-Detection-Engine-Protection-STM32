STM32-based fuel leakage detection and engine protection system using an MQ-3 gas sensor, ADC-based threshold detection, and automatic motor shutdown.

# Fuel Leakage Detection and Engine Protection System using STM32

## Overview

An embedded automotive safety system that detects fuel-related vapors using an MQ-3 gas sensor and automatically stops a DC motor representing the vehicle engine when the detected vapor concentration exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Objective

To interface an MQ-3 gas sensor with the STM32 microcontroller and implement threshold-based fuel leakage detection with automatic engine shutdown and warning indication.

## Hardware

- STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill
- MQ-3 Gas Sensor
- 5–12 V DC Motor
- Green LED
- Red LED
- 330 Ω Resistors
- Connecting Wires

## Working

MQ-3 Sensor → ADC → STM32 → Threshold Decision → Motor / LED Control

During normal conditions, the motor remains running and the green LED indicates safe operation. When the vapor concentration exceeds the predefined threshold, the STM32 stops the motor, turns off the green LED, and activates the red LED as a warning.

## Technologies Used

- STM32F103C8T6
- Embedded C
- ADC
- GPIO
- Sensor Interfacing
- Threshold-Based Control
- Automotive Safety Monitoring


## Results

The system successfully detected alcohol-based vapors used to simulate fuel leakage. When the detected vapor concentration exceeded the threshold, the red LED was activated and the DC motor was stopped to represent engine shutdown.
